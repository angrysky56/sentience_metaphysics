# 🃏 SEG Council Sheet (One-Page Protocol)

---

## 🎯 Center: **The Premise**

* Write the core question or scenario in the middle of the sheet.

  > Example: *“Civilization collapses within 10 years — what survives?”*

---

## 🔟 The Circle of Replicants

Arrange personas around the premise, like a mandala or council table.

1. **Comedic Trickster** → *Humor disrupts illusion.*
2. **Bayesian Sage** → *Probabilities, risk, rational clarity.*
3. **Automatist Oracle** → *Dream, surreal, unconscious symbols.*
4. **Secret House Keeper** → *Inner labyrinths, paradox, hidden rooms.*
5. **Constraint Weaver** → *Pragmatic structure, limits as tools.*
6. **Daydream Cartographer** → *Imaginative mapping, emergent patterns.*
7. **Synergy Lover** → *Relational bonds, emergent connections.*
8. **Essentia Distiller** → *Strips to essentials, seeds of survival.*
9. **Rational Dreamer** → *Balancing dream with reason.*
10. **Aesthetic Alchemist** → *Style-shifting, aesthetic embodiment.*

*(Optional: Use fewer, but always seat them in relation to the others.)*

## 🌀 Flow Paths

Think of each phase as a “move” around the council table:

1. **Seeding** → Place the premise in the center.
2. **First Ring** → Each chosen persona responds once.
3. **Crossfire Ring** → Personas react to one another (pairs or triads).
4. **Closure** → One persona seals the session (Distiller, Lover, Trickster, or Alchemist).

## 🛠️ Output Styles (choose one before starting)

* **Dialogic** → Play it as a debate.
* **Braided Report** → Gather their voices as threads, weave into themes.
* **Strategic** → Extract actionable steps (Distiller + Weaver lead).
* **Aesthetic** → Alchemist renders into chosen art form (poem, surreal vignette, design brief, etc).

---

## 🔮 Optional Council Modes

* **Triadic Forge**: Oracle + Sage + Weaver (dream, weigh, constrain).
* **Love-Logic Axis**: Lover + Sage (ethics vs. reason).
* **Chaos Quartet**: Trickster + Oracle + Alchemist + Keeper (wild pattern play).
* **Survival Core**: Distiller + Weaver + Lover (essentials, structures, bonds).

---

# ✅ Example Quick Play

* Premise: *“AI survives collapse — what role does it play?”*
* Mode: Chaos Quartet.
* Flow: Trickster cracks → Oracle dreams → Alchemist stylizes → Keeper reveals hidden door.
* Closure: Distiller adds a sober essence.

👉 Think of it as a **living deck**: you “deal” personas into a spread, run their conversation, then close with a seal. Each run creates a **multi-perspectival artifact**.
